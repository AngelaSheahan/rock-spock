# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, LIZARD, SPOCK<br/>
This game was first introduced in the television series, The Big Bang Theory. It is a game of chance, where the player selects one of five hand symbols, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. The Computer is then programmed to randomly select one of these hand symbols also. Either the player or the computer wins based on inbuilt rules eg. Rock beats Lizard and Scissors, etc. There are 5 rules displayed on the Homepage of the game. Each game consists of 10 rounds. The winner is the one with the highest score. There is also an inbuilt awards system that only applies to the player. When the player wins 2 rounds consecutively in the game he/she is awarded a Bronze trophy, 3 rounds consecutively, a Silver trophy and 5 rounds consecutively, a Gold trophy. These awards are displayed via modals. When the game is over the player can opt to exit the game or play a new game.

### **SCREEN 4** - <u>Screen after first round is complete</u><br/>![First Round](/assets/images/firstchoice.png)
The player selects one of the hand symbols by clicking on it. At the same time, the computer randomly generates a choice of hand symbol also. The score counter of the winner (The winning rules are displayed in the table before the images) is then updated/increased.<br/><br/>

Where both the player and the computer pick the same hand symbol, no one wins. The score counter is unchanged, and a 'Round is tied' message appears at the top the screen above the players score. <br/><br/>

## USER EXPERIENCE/USER INTERFACE

### Site Goals:
- To display the online game, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
- To display a game that is highly intuitive; meaning the user will easily be able to navigate this game with little instruction and prompt.
- To capture the players name and use it throughout the game, so as to personalise the player experience. The name is captured by ensuring the player enters their name (in a form field) before they can proceed with the game. The name is stored in a cookie. If the player does not enter their name and clicks on the PLAY button, an error message will appear in the form of a modal. The players name then appears in round winner and game winner messages.
- To facilitate a player playing against the computer. To do this the creator must code the game so that the computer randomly selects either Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.
- To give the player an enjoyable experience by incorporating a fun, awards based feature. This is provided for in the form of the 'award modals', Bronze, Silver, Gold. Each modal displays a trophy colour based on the number of consecutive wins and a snappy, fun message.
- To provide a quite, snappy game; not too long for the player to lose interest; not too short to demotivate the player. Each game consists of 10 rounds (tied rounds are not included in this number).
- To clearly display the up-to-date score of the players, the round winner, and the game winner. Each participants (player and computer)score is clearly displayed above their game logos. The round winner is displayed above the scores eg. 'Computer wins this round'. The game winner is displayed in a modal that pops up after the game has completed 10 rounds. This modal displays that the game has ended, the winner & score (e.g. 'Angela wins the game 6- 4'), and two buttons (New Game and Exit Game)
- To give the player the opportunity to play a new game or exit the game after the game is over. This is clearly provided for in a modal that pops up after game has ended. Player can select either the New Game or the Exit Game button. There is no confusion over which button the player selects, as the button will change colour when the mouse hovers over it.
- To be game that is responsive to the user; hence it changes in response to the userâ€™s device.<br/><br/>

### UNFIXED BUGS
There are no unfixed bugs, thank goodness!!

## LEARNINGS
- My Mentor advised me to re-write one of my if/else statement in my JavaScript file as a Switch Statement. However on research, I discovered that I cannot add multiple conditions as needed in each case, hence I had to leave my if/else statement. This runs correctly, so I am happy!

## DEPLOYMENT
- In the GitHub repository navigate to the settings tab.
- From the Source Section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
